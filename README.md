## Prerequisites
 - install Qlik WebConnectors (for this you can use the free "Qlik SMTP Connector" without a license) https://da3hntz84uekx.cloudfront.net/WebConnectors/2.59.5/1/_MSI/QlikWebConnectorsMay2019Patch1.zip
 - The connector has been renamed from Notification Connector (as shown in the videos)

 - Download and upload to your server this <a href="Send%20Email.qvf">app</a>
 - Adjust the connections, the folder connections "C" and "SendEmailLog" (this has to point to a temp folder). 
 - I suppose you will have your own data and don't want "Northwind" MS Access database
